# VotingApp
A full stack web development project used to simulate the student union elections in the College campus but in a digitized form. 
The app conatins a fully functioning SignUo page as well as a functioning login page with user authentication. Tech stack used: 
1. Node JS
2. Express JS
3. React JS
4. MongoDB
5. Bootstrap
   
The App still requires a better UI/UX but serves the basic purpose of being helpful in digitizing the tedious elections process. From viewing the candidates manifesto to casting a vote everything is present on the user side of the app. There are still many changes to be made to the app adding an admin side which can overlook the whole process.
